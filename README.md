# Long_Distance_Call
A long-distance provider charges the following rates for telephone calls:
Rate Category Rate per Minute
Daytime (6:00 a.m. through 5:59 p.m.) $0.07
Evening (6:00 p.m. through 11:59 p.m.) $0.12
Off-Peak (12:00 a.m. through 5:59 a.m.) $0.05

Create a GUI application that allows the user to select a rate category (from a set of radio 
buttons), and enter the number of minutes of the call into a text field. A dialog box should 
display the charge for the call.
